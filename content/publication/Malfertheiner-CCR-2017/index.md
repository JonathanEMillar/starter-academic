abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) and extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) are increasingly used in the management of severe respiratory failure. With bleeding complications being one of the major risks of these techniques, our aim in this systematic review was to assess the available literature on acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and extracorporeal support. AvWS has previously been associated with bleeding and shear stress. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES:A systematic review, using Medline via PubMed, was performed to identify eligible studies up to January 2017. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:The prevalence of AvWF among patients on VV ECMO or ECCO2R is high, but only a limited number of studies are reported in the literature. AvWS testing should be performed, including vWF multimer analysis, vWF activity and vWF antigen concentration. The extent to which vWF contributes to bleeding during ECMO, or how much changes in ECMO management can influence high molecular weight vWF multimer levels, cannot be answered from the currently available evidence and there remains a need for future studies.
