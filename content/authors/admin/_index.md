Jonathan Millar works in the Baillie Lab, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh. His research interests include genome editing and the functional genomics of ARDS, unsupervised machine learning approaches to phenotyping , and large animal models of critical illness, including models of ECMO. He completed his doctoral work with Prof John Fraser (Critical Care Research Group, University of Queensland) and Prof Danny McAuley (Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, Queen's University Belfast), studying the role of mesenchymal stem cells and ECMO in ARDS. Since, under the supervision of Dr Kenneth Baillie, he has contributed to the Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) study and is working to develop *in-vitro* and *in-vivo* genome editing platforms to study the functional genomics of acute severe respiratory failure.
